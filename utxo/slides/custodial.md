# Custodial experience vs onboarding

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

<div>

- we want to make it easy to onboard

- first iteration - custodial experience (via email)
  - very easy to use
  - no need to install anything
  - many people won't share their email
  - on-boarding is just postponed 

- second iteration - onboarding via Nova Wallet
  - on-site experience
  - direct access to platform
  - privacy is respected
