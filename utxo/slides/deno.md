<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">
<div>

- JavaScript runtime (something like NodeJS)
- Written in Rust (We love Rust)
- Super fast and super safe
- Works with TypeScript out of the box
- Built-in tooling (no need for NPM)
- Works on serverless platforms (Deno Deploy)

## What is Fresh?

- WebFramework for Deno (like NextJS or Nuxt)
- Uses Preact (smaller than React)
- Zero JS shipped until you need it
