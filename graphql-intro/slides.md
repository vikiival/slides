# Why do we need indexers?

How to make queries in GraphQL

- **Do not sacrifice UX** - Reading data from the blockchain takes a lot of time and resources.

- **Analytics** - making data views is a great way to get insights into the data.

- **You can't process RMRK** - RMRK is basically string in the blockchain, so without indexers you can't process it.

- **Simple GraphQL interface** - a great way to get data from the blockchain.

# What is indexer?

Tool to process Substrate blocks one by one.

- **Two types of data in each block** - Events and extrinsics
  - **Extrinsics** - The call that each user makes to the chain (`system.remark`).
  - **Events** - Interactions that are emmited by the chain (`balances.Transfer`).
- **Rule of thumb** - It is more effective to process *events*.

# How does the processing works?


  1. For each block, extracts all requested extrinsics/events.
  2. For each event/extrinsic, call the pre-defined handler.
  3. Handler should transform the data to match the schema we defined.
  4. Save into the Postgres database.

# Which is indexers do we use?
And what are the differences?

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">


<div>

- üìù **SubQuery** - magick
  - Simplier one, less features
  - bit slower reindexing time
  - backbone of KodaDot's RMRK markteplace
  - so far *stable*
  - no ability for external calls
  - aggregations out of the box
  - auto-balanced for more nodes
</div>

<div>

- ü¶ë **SubSquid** - rubick
  - More complex, higher flexibility
  - super fast reindexing (~ 2days)
  - can be used for external calls (fetch metadata from IPFS)
  - *alpha quality software*
  - can write custom queries through resolvers
  - europe based
  
</div>
