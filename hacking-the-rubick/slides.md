# Recap: Why do we need indexers?

How to make queries in GraphQL

- **Do not sacrifice UX** - Reading data from the blockchain takes a lot of time and resources.

- **Analytics** - making data views is a great way to get insights into the data.

- **You can't process RMRK** - RMRK is basically a string in the blockchain, so without indexers, you can't process it.

- **Simple GraphQL interface** - a great way to get data from the blockchain.

# Recap: What is an indexer?

Tool to process Substrate blocks one by one.

- **Two types of data in each block** - Events and extrinsics
  - **Extrinsics** - The call that each user makes to the chain (`system.remark`).
  - **Events** - Interactions that are emitted by the chain (`balances.Transfer`).
- **Rule of thumb** - It is more effective to process *events*.

# Recap: How does the processing work?


  1. For each block, extracts all requested extrinsics/events.
  2. For each event/extrinsic, call the pre-defined handler.
  3. Handler should transform the data to match the schema we defined.
  4. Save into the Postgres database.

# How does the schema look like? (1)


```graphql
type CollectionEntity @entity {
  version: String
  name: String
  max: Int!
  issuer: String
  symbol: String
  id: ID!
  metadata: String
  currentOwner: String
  nfts: [NFTEntity!] @derivedFrom(field: "collection")
  events: [CollectionEvent!]
  blockNumber: BigInt
  meta: MetadataEntity
  createdAt: DateTime!
}
```


---

# How does the schema look like? (2)


```graphql
type NFTEntity @entity {
  name: String
  instance: String
  transferable: Int
  collection: CollectionEntity!
  issuer: String
  sn: String
  id: ID!
  hash: String! @index
  metadata: String
  currentOwner: String
  price: BigInt!
  burned: Boolean!
  blockNumber: BigInt
  events: [Event!] @derivedFrom(field: "nft")
  emotes: [Emote!] @derivedFrom(field: "nft")
  meta: MetadataEntity
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```
---

# How does the schema look like? (3)

```graphql
type Event implements EventType @entity {
  id: ID!
  blockNumber: BigInt
  timestamp: DateTime!
  caller: String!
  currentOwner: String! # currentOwner
  interaction: Interaction!
  meta: String!
  nft: NFTEntity!
}
```

# Let's query some data


[Built in SubSquid playground](https://app.gc.subsquid.io/beta/rubick/006/graphql)


### Example Task

Using **Rubick** fetch the first `10` NFTs that have been recently listed
- For the event, I want: `meta`, `timestamp`
- For NFT get: `id`, `name`
---

# Example Task (how I would write it)

Using **Rubick** fetch the first `10` NFTs that have been recently listed
- For the event, I want: `meta`, `timestamp`
- For NFT get: `id`, `name`

```graphql
query lastNftListByEvent($limit: Int!, $event: Interaction!) {
  events(
    limit: $limit
    where: { interaction_eq: $event, nft: {burned_eq: false} }
    orderBy: timestamp_DESC
  ) {
    meta
    timestamp
    nft {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

```

# OK, so what are resolvers?
and do we need them? 

- **Functions** - that expose certain data to the GraphQL schema.
- **Do not kill the user's device** - Parsing and processing data on the client-side is making the user's device slow.
- **Some queries are impossible to write** - Effectively, we can't write aggregation queries from GraphQL
- **Flexibility** - We can write queries that will return only the data we need.
- **No need for reindexing** - It's just a "server" extension.

---


# What's the current structure of Rubick?

- **mappings** - indexer's logic
- **model** - generated types  by subsquid
- **types** - our own types
- **server-extension** - folder for resolvers
  - *model* - how the data will look like in graphql
  - *query* - the logic to fetch the data from the DB
  - *resolvers* - function(s) that will be called when the query is executed

# Let's code <3

### Task 1 (issue #69)

resolver to check how many NFTs are listed
- parameters - `collectionId`
- should return `totalCount`

---

# Let's code <3

### Task 1 (How I would write it)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM nft_entity
WHERE collection_id = $1
AND price > 0;
```


---

# Let's code <3

### Task 2 (issue #29)

resolver for the last events
- parameters - `interaction`
- should return `events[]` where
- query should return `meta`, `timestamp`, `nft id`, `nft name`, `metadata image`, `event caller`, `nft issuer`

---

# Let's code <3

### Task 2 (How I would write it)

```sql
SELECT e.meta, e.timestamp as date, ne.id, ne.name, me.image, ne.issuer, e.caller
FROM event e
LEFT JOIN nft_entity ne ON ne.id = e.nft_id
LEFT JOIN metadata_entity me ON me.id = ne.meta_id
WHERE e.interaction = 'LIST'
ORDER BY e.timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10
```

---

# A time for resolver (1)

We will make a resolver for the query from task 2.

We need to edit 3 files:

```bash
cd rubick/server-extension/
touch query/event.ts
touch model/event.model.ts
touch resolvers/nftEvents.ts
```
---

# A time for resolver (2)

touch query/event.ts

First, we need to add the query:

```ts
export const nftEventList = `SELECT e.meta, e.timestamp as date, ne.id, ne.name, me.image, ne.issuer, e.caller
FROM event e
LEFT JOIN nft_entity ne ON ne.id = e.nft_id
LEFT JOIN metadata_entity me ON me.id = ne.meta_id
WHERE e.interaction = $1
ORDER BY e.timestamp DESC
LIMIT $2`
```

---

# A time for resolver (2)

touch model/event.model.ts

Second, we have to create the model:

```ts
@ObjectType()
export class TokenEventEntity {
  @Field(() => String, { nullable: false })
  id!: string
  @Field(() => String, { nullable: true })
  name!: string
  @Field(() => Date, { nullable: false })
  date!: Date
  @Field(() => String, { nullable: true, defaultValue: '' })
  meta!: string
  @Field(() => String, { nullable: true, defaultValue: '' })
  image!: string
  @Field(() => String, { nullable: false })
  issuer!: string
  @Field(() => String,{ nullable: false })
  caller!: string
}
```

---

# A time for resolver (3)

touch resolvers/nftEvents.ts

Third, we finish the resolver:

```ts
@Resolver()
export class NFTEventResolver {
  constructor(private tx: () => Promise<EntityManager>) {}

  @Query(() => [TokenEventEntity])
  async nftEventListByType(
    @Arg('type', { nullable: false }) type: Interaction,
    @Arg('limit', { nullable: true, defaultValue: null }) limit: number,
  ): Promise<TokenEventEntity[]> {
    const result: TokenEventEntity[] = await makeQuery(this.tx, EventEntity, nftEventList, [type, limit])
    return result
  }
}
```

---

# A time for resolver (4)

touch resolvers/index.ts

Last we need to register our resolver:

```ts
export {
  NFTEventResolver
}
```

---

# Let's test it
Let's play on the playground

```bash
just build
just serve
```

and pass the following query:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  nftEventListByType(type: "LIST", limit: 10) {
    id
    meta
    name
  }
}
```
